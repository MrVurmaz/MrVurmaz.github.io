        <p> Hi there 👋 Welcome to my portfolio!  My name is Uğur Vurmaz, from Türkiye 🇹🇷 currently I am residing in Finland 🇫🇮 with my spouse and kids since February, 2019.
            I hold 2 university degrees: Bachelor's in Russian Language and Literature and Master's in International Relations.
          I worked in different fields with various roles during my career such as customer service, sales, operations 
          and team management. Besides, I scaled a hobby business through which I gain B2B and B2C sales skills and some money. 💰
          <p>Essentially, I have been officially unemployed since last September due to the fact that I was laid off from my last workplace because of the unfortunate invasion of Ukraine 
             and its effects on the company's finances. For this reason, I am actively looking for a job, improving my Finnish skills
             in order to get Finnish citizenship next year, and I am learning some IT skills by myself such as web developing and software testing.
            In fact, I builded this portfolio by myself, so you can consider this ugly website as one of my beginner projects. 😊 </p> 
            <p> I must admit that I have been gaining lots of personal experiences during this unemployment period such as entering the IT ocean,
                 developing my Finnish language to pass the YKI test and most importantly staying psychologically strong and patient for a bright future. </p>
            <p> Like many people, I am keen to mention about my hobbies and finalize 'about me' section. I am into playing and watching football ➡️ Fenerbahçe is my favorite team.
                Also, I love watching films and socializing with my friends in the city. Most of all, I am interested in following daily politics of the world. 🌎  </p>
