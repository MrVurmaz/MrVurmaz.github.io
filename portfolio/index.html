        <p> Hi there üëã Welcome to my portfolio!  My name is Uƒüur Vurmaz, from T√ºrkiye üáπüá∑ I am residing in Finland üá´üáÆ with my spouse and kids since February, 2019.
            I hold 2 university degrees: Bachelor's in Russian Language and Literature and Master's in International Relations.
          I worked in different fields with various roles during my career such as customer service, sales, operations 
          and team management. Besides, I scaled a successful hobby business through which I gain B2B and B2C sales skills. ‚úì
          <p>Essentially, I have been officially unemployed since last September due to the fact that I was laid off from my last workplace because of the unfortunate invasion of Ukraine 
             and its effects on the company's finances. For this reason, I am actively looking for a job, improving my Finnish skills
             to be able to get the Finnish citizenship next year, and I am learning some IT skills such as web developing and software testing.
            In fact, I built this portfolio by myself, so you can consider this ugly website as one of my beginner projects. üòä </p> 
            <p> I must admit that I have been gaining lots of personal experiences during this unemployment period such as diving into the IT ocean,
                 developing my Finnish language and most importantly staying mentally strong and patient for a bright future. ‚ú® </p>
            <p> Like many people, I am keen to mention about my hobbies and finalize the section about me. I am into playing and watching football ‚û°Ô∏è Fenerbah√ße is my favorite team.
                Also, I love movies, going out and socializing with my friends. Most of all, I am interested in the following latest news on global politics. üåé </p>
