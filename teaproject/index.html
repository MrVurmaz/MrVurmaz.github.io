  <h1 id="title-site"> Benefits of Tea </h1>
  <p> Numerous studies have shown that a variety of teas may <b> boost your immune
    system, fight off inflammation, and even ward off cancer and heart disease.
  </b> </p>
    <p> While some brews provide more health advantages than others,
    there's plenty of evidence that regularly drinking tea can have a lasting
    impact on your wellness. </p>
  <p>Turkish tea is <b>rich in antioxidants and is believed to
      lower cholesterol levels and is also good for cardiovascular health.</b>
      Brewed black tea is served with or without sugar cubes, other sweets
      and pastries. </p>

    <h3 id="how"> How to make Turkish tea &nbsp; <i class="fa-solid fa-mug-hot"></i> </h3>
    <p> <u> The proper method of making Turkish tea includes the following steps:</u> </p>
    <ol id="list">
      <li>We boil water in two different pots – using one small pot for a very
        strong tea brew, and a larger pot (or kettle) for additional
        boiled water. </li>
        <li>Boil your water in the smaller pot. To the boiled water,
          add one teaspoon of tea into the pot for each glass (100mL) you will
           serve. Allow the mixture to brew for approximately 10 minutes –
           there is no need for reheating. </li>
          <li>Boil the additional water in your larger pot (or kettle).</li>
          <li>To serve: Fill each glass only 1/3 with the brewed tea mixture.
              The rest of the glass should be topped with additional boiled water.
               However, the proportions can be adjusted to suit your taste.
               A good Turkish tea should be almost red in colour when served.
                You can (as the Turks do!) add sugar to your liking. </li> </ol>
